I started this journey looking to make a simple inventory tracker, dice roller, and Adventurer's Journal for my first tabletop RPG. It has become more than that in such a short time. On friday I started building out just a simple character. Yesterday I continued that route, before adding so many new features that I needed to take it back to the board. 

I spent yesterday figuring out the user flow, today as I am wireframing I have decided to move the name generation to the final step, before finalizing your character.

Today I have been working on a digital flowchart to help me get page layouts. This is leading to hours of research regarding fantasy races, skills, and abilities I have never worked with before, the variables are going to be overwhelming and I am wondering if Redux may be a better way to manage state, however, I am leaning towards context. Overall, I am glad I took it back to the board, before coding out a big mistake. 

The pages are going to be far more work than I realized. retrieving information about a single race is going to take 4 or 5 different api calls. I understand that is better than having to design the entire DB myself, but we'll see. Will need to spend a lot of time working on graphQL schemas, types.

DnD beyond is exactly what I was trying to build only better. I am going to replan.
